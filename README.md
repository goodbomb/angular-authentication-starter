# AngularJS Authentication Starter App

This Angular starter app is built on top of the AngularJS-Gulp-Browserify starter app (https://github.com/goodbomb/angular-gulp-browserify-starter). The goal is to build proper login and registration authentication through POST requests to a Ruby on Rails API (https://github.com/goodbomb/rails-grape-api) on a separate domain.
